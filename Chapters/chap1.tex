\chapter{Electric Charge and Electric Field}

\subsection{Electric Charge}
\textbf{Electromagnetism} (EM) affects only charged particles, mainly electrons and protons. All particles have charges that are integer multiples of the elementary charge $e$ such that the charge is given by
\begin{equation}
q = ne,
\end{equation}
where $q$ represents charge (C), $n$ represents an integer, and $e = \SI{1.6022e-19}{C}$ represents the elementary charge.

Electric charge is conserved. This means that the total charge of any isolated system with no charge moving in or out stays the same|charge is never created or destroyed. 

\textbf{Coulomb's Law} states that charges of the same sign repel and charges of the opposite sign attract. Furthermore, the force $F$ produced by charges can be calculated via
\begin{equation}
F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2},
\end{equation}
where $k = \SI{9.0e9}{\frac{N m^2}{C^2}}$, $q_1$ represents the first charge, $q_2$ represents the second charge, and $r$ represents the separation distance.

\subsection{Conductors and Insulators}
Conductors are materials that conduct electricity, whereas insulators do not conduct electricity.
